# Searching Server - Second Mile Stone 

This searching server made my Roei Ben-Zee'v and Asaf Jerbi is a seraching server using various of searching algorithms to calculate the cheapest path from source state to target state.


## Why do we need this?

In our previous project (First Mile Stone) we caused the Cessna airplane to take off, but no target was for this. In this section, we have developed this searching server which will help us in the future to search the best path for our Cessna airplane to arrive from point A to point B. 


## Algorithms

This searching server is using 4 main searching algorithms: A*, Best First Search, BFS and DFS. 

## How to use it
Meanwhile, the server gets a Matrix in size nXn, a source point and a target point as a searching problem and then returns the solution. 
In order to save time, we have made a cache memory for our solutions - by this, before we are perform the search using the algorithms, we check whether the solution is already exist andd returns it. otherwise, we calculate the solution.
